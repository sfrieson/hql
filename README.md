# HQL

A SQL inspired query language for HTML documents.

## Goals

I have two goals for this project:

1. Learn/practice Python
I am just now learning Python and wanted a project to do with it.  I figured this might be a good one since it has the opportunity for data analysis.

1. Create a new language for fun
I thought it'd be an intersting experiment to create a new language.


These two things being the main reasonings, I'm expecting some big diffs, big re-writes, and probably a few start overs.  We'll see how this goes.
